# Get started with Pinterest API v5 Oauth Flow

Use index.php to get Pinterest API token the easy way (it took me quite some time before I could find the way to start the Oauth Flow)

Place the index.php anywhere in htdocs and launch it from a browser

The image bellow is a screenshot of what you will get, just follow the instructions

## This will help you to :

- Start the OAuth flow
- Receive the access code
- Get an access token

As described in the docs :
